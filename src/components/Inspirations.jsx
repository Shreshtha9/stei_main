Her unwavering commitment to nurturing talent left a lasting impression on me, and even after all these years, she remains someone I deeply respect and look up to for her wisdom and guidance. Today, as a creative professional in market research, with over a decade of experience in clinical research and digital marketing, and with being a consultant for budding brands, I still find myself inspired by the lessons she imparted. Her emphasis on building confidence and honing professional skills has been invaluable in my professional and personal journey. I wish Dr. Tewari all the very best for her new venture, STEI.

While it is no news that she is an exceptional educator, what makes her special for the likes of me is how well she sees right through you! We have all struggled with self-doubt & uncertainty during our learning years, & it isn't uncommon to find people who have well-meaning suggestions to offer at this stage. But finding someone who works with you, helping you find your own answers â€“ jackpot! Many can offer you encouragement in life, Professor Sandhya offers you the precious gift of the ability to renew your sense of self-confidence. One other distinctive power Professor Sandhya has, that I have forever looked up to & have always strived to emulate, is to always speak clearly and directly, no matter what.
